This is a project I worked on as a student at Hack Reactor. This project was worked on with a pair.
# Subclass-Dance-Party

We created dancers that were subclasses of a main Dancer class. This allowed our subclasses to exhibit individuality while allowing the subclass to inherit useful methods from their superclass. Our dancers consisted of minions that could either blink, slide across the screen, or hop up and down.
